NASA has shared a stunning picture of Enceladus, the sixth-largest moon of Saturn known to harbor oceans beneath its frozen crust. In the color-enhanced image, snapped by the Cassini spacecraft, pale blue fractures—possibly rivers—cut through the surface of the moon and deep craters have also been spotted. The planet is not completely visible since it's obscured by the moon's shadow.
