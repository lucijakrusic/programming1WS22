The only important thing is that you never mix tabs and spaces, because you may not be able to distinguish them in the editor, but Python balks at them. But you have this problem only with simple editors. Integrated development environments like PyCharm or VS Code, but also specialized tools like Jupyter Notebooks, automatically take care of consistency here.\n",
